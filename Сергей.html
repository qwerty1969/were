<p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1 enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>


<p>What you need to know is that "Time Is Money".<span class="new3">
And this applies <span class="new2">even more</span> to the online world</span>, than in regular business.</p>


<p>You see, <b>anyone can become</b> an online entrepreneur.
It doesn't <i>involve start-up capital</i> or expensive equipment to start.
A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>


<p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has become all the more critical.
Your challenge for success is simply to get more done - in less time.</p>


<p class="new2"> So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can you do to avoid them?</p>


<ol start="0">
<li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>


<li >Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>


<li >Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>


<li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
</ol>

<h6 class="new">Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h6>


<p>This sounds simple.
But stop and think how many times you retype the same old simple information.</p>


<p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to communicating words quickly.</p>


<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender.
This will enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever having to type the same thing twice.</p>


<p>I use this utility <a href="http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot" target="_blank" title="Програма type pilot	">http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot</a>
, but there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities available.</p>


<h2>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h2>


<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your own installed on your computer.</p>


<span class="new5"><p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software set up.
Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the emails that you don't want.
Make sure they are filtered into a junk email file, so you can manually sift through them afterwards and pull back any that have been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p></span>


<p>ii.
Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly organized.
I keep a folder for SALES, another one for FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.</p>
